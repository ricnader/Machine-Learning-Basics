  <li>
    For pyTorch installation refer to
    https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
    (example of command for installing pytorch - pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118)

  <li>
    For tensorFlow installation refer to
    https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?hl=pt-br#windows-wsl2
    (example of command for installing tensorFlow - --pip install tensorflow)
