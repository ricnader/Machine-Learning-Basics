# NumPy's basic data structure is an indexable, 
# n-dimensional array containing elements of the same type (dtype). 
# Right away, you may notice we have overloaded the term 'dimension'. 
# Above, it was the number of elements in the vector, here, dimension 
# refers to the number of indexes of an array. A one-dimensional or 1-D 
# array has one index. In Course 1, we will represent vectors as NumPy 1-D arrays.
